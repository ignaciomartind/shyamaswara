        A name that just showed up in my heart..<br></br>
        This was the name that suited my journey with words.<br></br>
        </p><br></br>
        <p>Sometimes, Life is like a dream... and at other times, the dream is your life.<br></br>
        These stories, these songs, these colors are like a lover, that himself came to me.<br></br>
        So there is nothing special about me.. I am trying to incorporate the pieces of my dream into this page called Śyāmasvara.<br></br>
        </p><br></br>
        <p>To be talking about myself and my achievements is a lot of hard-work for me…<br></br>
        A few stories held my hand initially and a few years later in the new form of a Lyricist, and a new hobby called Painting, drowned me into a river of new colors.<br></br>
        </p><br></br>
        <p>I am not restricted by training or processes and write and draw with a free tone.<br></br>
        I have worked on each painting and each song, as they showed up in me.<br></br>
        Śyāmasvara is the simple and free expression of a lover of unbridled privacy.<br></br>
        </p><br></br>
        <p>Along this path, on this journey, I hope that all your love will make me a better Lyricist, a Painter, a Shaayar, and in some form.<br></br>
        Lots of Love.<br></br>
        Anujaya<br></br>
        Śyāmasvara<br></br>
